\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
    In our work, we considered an overloaded M2M communication system by using beta arrival distribution. We propose a new grouping concept of access class barring scheme without additional overheads and a heuristic algorithm which adaptively change ACB factor based on the RAN overload level in the previous time slot. We also try to increase the group size by dividing the segments of the maximum allowable transmissions, but the results show that when we increasing the number of group size, the access delay will be worse, and the access success probability will be much better. So how to control the group size in different scenario is another issue we can discuss. Results show that the heuristic algorithm can reduce the access delay effectively and maintain a great standard of access success probability.
