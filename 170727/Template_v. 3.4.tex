\section{Debug the experiment for proposed solution}

\begin{frame}{In Verify function}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {The output of Sign function M, N is not equal to the variable M' and N' in Verify function}
        \item {The description for these function are fuzzy so that I'm not sure the correct way to implement}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item [-] {$h_k = H_1(m||M||N||R_1||\rho ||U_k)$}
            \item [-] {$\mu_0 = H_0(0||r_0||m||ring)$}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame} {Solution}  
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {As the description on paper, the Verify function is run on the AS side}
        \item {So that it's can be removed from UE side program}
    \end{itemize}
