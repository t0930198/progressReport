\begin{frame} {Aim} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{In order to alleviate the RAN overload,}
        \item {We focus on the objective that can increase access success probability and relieve the access delays.}
        \item \textbf{Accroding to traditional ACB factor is fixed.}
        \item {We proposed an algorithm to make eNB be able to change ACB factor dynamically.}

        \item {when UE device is switched on or handover from on eNB to another.}
        \item{will contend resource blocks with others.}
        \item{Is classified into two type in LTE, contend based and contend free.}

    \begin{itemize}

            \item if fail to receive RAR, it will wait for a backoff time to retry if the number of transmission is smaller than maximum
