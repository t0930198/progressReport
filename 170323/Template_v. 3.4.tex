\section{Extended Access Barring}

\begin{frame}{Briefly introduce EAB \cite{6489075}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {The device is divided into two types}
        \begin{itemize}    
            \item[-]{delay sensitive}
            \item[-]{delay tolerant}
        \end{itemize}
        \item {EAB is used for device which be delay-tolerant}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Briefly introduce EAB \cite{spec}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {There is 10 AC level for devices (0...9)}
        \item {In SIB14, there is a bitmap called barringBitmap, if the corresponding bit is 1, then the device will be barred}
        \item {It's not evolved from ACB}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Process of Access Barring in NB-IOT}

\begin{frame}{NB-IoT v.s. LTE (different)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {NB-IoT adopt EAB as the based of access barring mechanism}
        \item {It's similar to access barring check of NB-IoT and EAB check, but NB-Iot has more If Else for there spec}
        \begin{itemize}    
            \item[-]{AC level 11...15}
            \item[-]{exception Data}
        \end{itemize}
