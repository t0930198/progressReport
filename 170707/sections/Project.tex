\section{Wearable Project}
\label{project}
    An Android project to communicate with two BLE device, the bracelet and glass.
    The bracelet can be distinct the color of an object, alarm when it's close to other objects.
    The glasses can read the QRcode Message and know it's in a crowded place.
    This application can send/receive message to/from device, and speak the message from device to user.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {New UI flow} Fig.~\ref{fig_UI_flow}
        \item {Bracelet device}
        \begin{itemize}    
            \item[-]{Seek Bracelet - change the notification way to the alarm instead of vibrate}
            \item[-]{Color Detection - new data format}
            \item[-]{Distance Detection - the bracelet only work well once}
            \item[-]{Power Information - hard code in bracelet}
            \item[-]{Connection switch - new connect and disconnect approach in new design}
        \end{itemize}
        \item {New layout, and new layout...} Fig.~\ref{fig_UI_design}
        \item {To demonstrate the application successfully  on the final exhibition}
    \end{itemize}
