\section{Intorduction}
\begin{frame}{Intorduction}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {A study of security, privacy, fairness requirements in fog-based vehicle crowdsensing}
        \item {And discuss the possible solutions}
        \item {Fog-based vehicle crowdsensing (FVCS) can provide local services (e.g., real-time nevigation, parking space reservation)}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Challenges}
\begin{frame}{Challenges - Security}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {Malicious hacker might extract personal info from the intersaction of multiple crowdsensing report}
        \item {In authentication issue, the blacklist should be built to resist impersonation attacks and Sybil attacks}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Challenges - Privacy}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {The sensing data are related to people-centric information, also included where driver and passenger are goin or what place they frequently visit}
        \item {The more promising method to protect vehicles' privacy is to use anonymity technology (e.g., group signature, k-anonymity)}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Challenges - Fairness}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {How to guarantee the fairness of vehicles is dramatically critaical}
        \item {The data sensed from same position inevitably contain some duplicates, which may waste massive bandwidth and storage}
        \item {It is necessary to design a verifiable reward distribution mechanism for vehicles to ensure their fairness}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\section{Solution}
\begin{frame}{Solution - Security}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {A Trusted Authority (TA) should be involved to achieve key management}
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Solution - Privacy}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {Use signature generated by TA to accomplish privacy requirement}
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Solution - Fairness}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {The straightforward method is to discard the duplicate data; however, to disclose the sensing report will leak personal information}
    \end{itemize}
